# Sunnyside Product Insights POC

A Tampermonkey userscript that enhances the Sunnyside flower listing page by displaying detailed terpene and cannabinoid profiles on hover, and enabling side-by-side comparison of up to 3 selected products.

## Features

- **Hover Tooltips**: Hover over any product card to see its cannabinoid profile (THC, THCA, CBD, CBDa) and terpene list
- **Product Selection**: Click "Select" on up to 3 products to add them to comparison
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Click the "Compare" button to view selected products in a comparison sidebar
- **Real-time Data**: Fetches fresh product data from detail pages on demand

## Installation

1. **Install Tampermonkey Extension**
   - Chrome: [Tampermonkey Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
   - Firefox: [Tampermonkey Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
   - Edge: [Tampermonkey Edge Extension](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd)

2. **Install the Script**
   - Click the Tampermonkey icon in your browser toolbar
   - Select "Create a new script..."
   - Delete the default template code
   - Copy and paste the entire contents of `sunnyside-insights.user.js`
   - Press `Ctrl+S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+S` (Mac) to save

3. **Enable the Script**
   - The script should be enabled by default
   - Navigate to `https://www.sunnyside.shop/products/flower`
   - The script will automatically activate on flower listing pages

## Usage

### Viewing Product Insights

1. Navigate to the [Sunnyside Flower Products page](https://www.sunnyside.shop/products/flower)
2. Hover your mouse over any product card
3. A tooltip will appear showing:
   - **Cannabinoids**: THC, THCA, CBD, CBDa percentages
   - **Terpenes**: List of terpenes (e.g., Myrcene, Caryophyllene, Limonene, Linalool)

### Comparing Products

1. **Select Products**: Click the orange "Select" button on up to 3 product cards
   - Selected products will show "Selected âœ“" in green
   - Maximum of 3 products can be selected at once

2. **Open Comparison**: Click the "Compare (X)" button in the bottom-right corner
   - X shows the number of selected products
   - A sidebar will slide in from the right

3. **View Comparison**: The sidebar displays a comparison table with:
   - Product names in the header
   - Cannabinoid profiles side-by-side
   - Terpene lists for each product

4. **Close Comparison**: Click the "âœ•" button in the top-right of the sidebar

## Technical Details

### How It Works

- **Product Detection**: The script identifies product cards using the selector `ul[role="region"] li button`
- **URL Extraction**: Multiple methods are used to extract product URLs:
  - Looking for `<a>` tags with product links
  - Checking data attributes
  - Parsing onclick handlers
  - Intercepting clicks to cache URLs
- **Data Fetching**: Uses `GM_xmlhttpRequest` to fetch product detail pages without CORS restrictions
- **Data Parsing**: Extracts cannabinoid percentages and terpene names from the HTML using DOM queries
- **Dynamic Updates**: Uses `MutationObserver` to handle dynamically loaded products (e.g., infinite scroll)

### Browser Compatibility

- âœ… Chrome/Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)
- âœ… Firefox
- âœ… Safari (with Tampermonkey)

### Limitations

- **No Caching**: Product data is fetched fresh on each hover (as per POC requirements)
- **Product URL Detection**: Some products may require a click before hover works (URL gets cached)
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects the website's rate limits - don't hover rapidly across many products
- **Structure Changes**: If Sunnyside updates their HTML structure, selectors may need adjustment

## Troubleshooting

### Tooltip Not Appearing

- **Check Script Status**: Click Tampermonkey icon â†’ Ensure script is enabled
- **Check Page URL**: Script only works on `/products/flower*` pages
- **Check Console**: Open browser DevTools (F12) â†’ Console tab â†’ Look for errors
- **Try Clicking First**: Some products may need one click to cache the URL before hover works

### Product Selection Not Working

- **Maximum Reached**: Only 3 products can be selected at once. Deselect one first.
- **Button Not Visible**: Scroll to see all product cards - selection buttons are added dynamically

### Comparison Sidebar Not Loading

- **No Products Selected**: Select at least one product first
- **Slow Network**: Product data fetching may take a few seconds - wait for "Loading..." to complete
- **Check Console**: Look for fetch errors in the browser console

### Data Not Showing

- **Product Out of Stock**: Some products may not have complete data
- **Missing Fields**: Some products may not have all cannabinoids or terpenes listed
- **Parse Errors**: Check console for parsing errors if data structure changed

## Development

### File Structure

```
Sunnyside/
â”œâ”€â”€ sunnyside-insights.user.js  # Main Tampermonkey script
â””â”€â”€ README.md                    # This file
```

### Customization

To modify the script:

1. Open Tampermonkey dashboard (click icon â†’ Dashboard)
2. Find "Sunnyside Product Insights POC"
3. Click the script name to edit
4. Make your changes
5. Save (Ctrl+S / Cmd+S)

### Common Customizations

- **Change Maximum Products**: Edit `selectedProducts.length >= 3` to change limit
- **Modify Tooltip Style**: Edit CSS in `createTooltip()` function
- **Add More Cannabinoids**: Extend the regex patterns in `fetchProductDetails()`
- **Change Colors**: Modify `SUNNYSIDE_ORANGE` and `SUNNYSIDE_DARK` constants

## Notes

- This is a **Proof of Concept** - not production-ready code
- No data caching is implemented (fetches on every hover)
- Respects the website's Terms of Service
- For personal/educational use only

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

- [ ] Add data caching to reduce server requests
- [ ] Support for other product types (Vapes, Edibles, etc.)
- [ ] Export comparison data to CSV/JSON
- [ ] Filter products by terpene/cannabinoid ranges
- [ ] Persistent selection (save selected products across sessions)
- [ ] Better error messages and retry logic
- [ ] Mobile-friendly tooltip positioning
