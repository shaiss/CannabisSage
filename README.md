# Cannabis Sage - Product Insights Enhancement

A Tampermonkey userscript that enhances cannabis ecommerce product listing pages by displaying detailed terpene and cannabinoid profiles on hover, and enabling side-by-side comparison of up to 3 selected products.

**Why This Matters**: Cannabinoid and terpene information is critical for making informed purchasing decisions, yet many cannabis ecommerce sites leave this essential data buried in product detail pages or completely hidden. This script brings this vital information directly to product listings where consumers need it most.

## Features

- **Hover Tooltips**: Hover over any product card to see its cannabinoid profile (THC, THCA, CBD, CBDa) and terpene list
- **Product Selection**: Click "Select" on up to 3 products to add them to comparison
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Click the "Compare" button to view selected products in a comparison sidebar
- **Real-time Data**: Fetches fresh product data from detail pages on demand

## Installation

1. **Install Tampermonkey Extension**
   - Chrome: [Tampermonkey Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
   - Firefox: [Tampermonkey Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
   - Edge: [Tampermonkey Edge Extension](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tampermonkey/iikmkjmpaadaobahmlepeloendndfphd)

2. **Install the Script**
   - Click the Tampermonkey icon in your browser toolbar
   - Select "Create a new script..."
   - Delete the default template code
   - Copy and paste the entire contents of `sunnyside-insights.user.js`
   - Press `Ctrl+S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+S` (Mac) to save

3. **Enable the Script**
   - The script should be enabled by default
   - Navigate to any supported cannabis ecommerce site's product listing page
   - The script will automatically activate on compatible product listing pages

## Usage

### Viewing Product Insights

1. Navigate to any supported cannabis ecommerce site's product listing page
2. Hover your mouse over any product card
3. A tooltip will appear showing:
   - **Cannabinoids**: THC, THCA, CBD, CBDa percentages
   - **Terpenes**: List of terpenes (e.g., Myrcene, Caryophyllene, Limonene, Linalool)
   
   This information is often missing or hard to find on product listing pages, making it difficult to compare products without clicking through to each individual product page.

### Comparing Products

1. **Select Products**: Click the orange "Select" button on up to 3 product cards
   - Selected products will show "Selected âœ“" in green
   - Maximum of 3 products can be selected at once

2. **Open Comparison**: Click the "Compare (X)" button in the bottom-right corner
   - X shows the number of selected products
   - A sidebar will slide in from the right

3. **View Comparison**: The sidebar displays a comparison table with:
   - Product names in the header
   - Cannabinoid profiles side-by-side
   - Terpene lists for each product

4. **Close Comparison**: Click the "âœ•" button in the top-right of the sidebar

## Technical Details

### How It Works

- **Product Detection**: The script identifies product cards using the selector `ul[role="region"] li button`
- **URL Extraction**: Multiple methods are used to extract product URLs:
  - Looking for `<a>` tags with product links
  - Checking data attributes
  - Parsing onclick handlers
  - Intercepting clicks to cache URLs
- **Data Fetching**: Uses `GM_xmlhttpRequest` to fetch product detail pages without CORS restrictions
- **Data Parsing**: Extracts cannabinoid percentages and terpene names from the HTML using DOM queries
- **Dynamic Updates**: Uses `MutationObserver` to handle dynamically loaded products (e.g., infinite scroll)

### Browser Compatibility

- âœ… Chrome/Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.)
- âœ… Firefox
- âœ… Safari (with Tampermonkey)

### Limitations

- **No Caching**: Product data is fetched fresh on each hover (as per POC requirements)
- **Product URL Detection**: Some products may require a click before hover works (URL gets cached)
- **Rate Limiting**: Respects the website's rate limits - don't hover rapidly across many products
- **Structure Changes**: If sites update their HTML structure, selectors may need adjustment
- **Site-Specific**: Each cannabis ecommerce site may require custom configuration for optimal compatibility

## Troubleshooting

### Tooltip Not Appearing

- **Check Script Status**: Click Tampermonkey icon â†’ Ensure script is enabled
- **Check Page URL**: Script only works on compatible product listing pages
- **Check Console**: Open browser DevTools (F12) â†’ Console tab â†’ Look for errors
- **Try Clicking First**: Some products may need one click to cache the URL before hover works
- **Site Compatibility**: Ensure the site is supported - some sites may require custom configuration

### Product Selection Not Working

- **Maximum Reached**: Only 3 products can be selected at once. Deselect one first.
- **Button Not Visible**: Scroll to see all product cards - selection buttons are added dynamically

### Comparison Sidebar Not Loading

- **No Products Selected**: Select at least one product first
- **Slow Network**: Product data fetching may take a few seconds - wait for "Loading..." to complete
- **Check Console**: Look for fetch errors in the browser console

### Data Not Showing

- **Product Out of Stock**: Some products may not have complete data
- **Missing Fields**: Some products may not have all cannabinoids or terpenes listed
- **Parse Errors**: Check console for parsing errors if data structure changed

## Development

- For personal/educational use only

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

- [ ] Add data caching to reduce server requests
- [ ] Support for other product types (Vapes, Edibles, etc.)
- [ ] Export comparison data to CSV/JSON
- [ ] Filter products by terpene/cannabinoid ranges
